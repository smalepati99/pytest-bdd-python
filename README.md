*Behavior-Driven Python with pytest-bdd* 


## Setup
This project requires an up-to-date version of Python 3.
It also uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) to manage packages.

## Running Tests
Run tests simply using the `pytest` command.
Depending upon your environment, it may be better to use `python -m pytest`.
If you are using `pipenv`, then run `pipenv run python -m pytest`.
Use the "-k" option to filter tests by tags.
